# Predator Drone Simulation with Three.js

This repository contains a web page that simulates a Predator drone using Three.js technology. The simulation includes a basic terrain generated using Perlin noise, a 3D model of the Predator drone, and animations for various parts such as the propeller or the landing gear, accompanied by directional sound effects. Additionally, basic collision detection is implemented.

## Features

- Autogenerated terrain using Perlin noise
- 3D model of the Predator drone
- Animations for propeller and landing gear
- Directional sound effects
- Basic collision detection

## Getting Started

To run the software, simply host the web page. If you're using Python, you can serve the web page using the following command:

```bash
python -m http.server
```

## Usage

The usage of the simulation is straightforward. There are simple buttons on the screen to control the drone's movements.
