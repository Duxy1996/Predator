# Predator Drone Simulation with Three.js ‚úàÔ∏è

Welcome to the Predator Drone Simulation repository! This project is a work-in-progress web-based simulation of the Predator MQ-9 Reaper drone, developed using Three.js. The Predator MQ-9 Reaper is a versatile unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) primarily used for reconnaissance and ground attack missions by various armed forces worldwide. As an aircraft enthusiast, the aim of this project is to deepen my understanding of Three.js while creating an immersive virtual experience of piloting this iconic drone.

The simulation features autogenerated terrain that mimics real-world landscapes using Perlin noise algorithms. It incorporates basic collision detection to ensure realistic interaction with the environment and offers interactive controls for piloting the drone. This project is under continuous development, with ongoing improvements to enhance the flight dynamics, expand features such as landing systems, and refine the overall user experience.

## Features üí°

- **Autogenerated Terrain**: Terrain is generated using Perlin noise for a realistic landscape.
- **3D Predator MQ-9 Reaper Model**: Includes detailed modeling of the drone, complete with two EGBU bombs.
- **Animations**: Features animations for the propeller and landing gear.
- **Directional Sound Effects**: Immersive sound effects that follow the drone‚Äôs movements.
- **Basic Collision Detection**: Simple collision detection mechanisms for the terrain.
- **First-Person View**: Switch to a cockpit view for a more immersive experience.
- **Basic Autopilot**: Includes a rudimentary autopilot system.
- **Control Over Drone Movements**: Command the drone‚Äôs roll and pitch using on-screen controls.
